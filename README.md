# Cylinder Volume Calculator

This project contains a program designed to calculate the volume of a cylinder based on its radius and height. The result is rounded to 4 decimal places for precision and clarity.

## Formula  
The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:  
\[ V = pi * r^2 * h ]  
Where:  
- \( V \): Volume of the cylinder  
- \( r \): Radius of the cylinder  
- \( h \): Height of the cylinder  
- \( pi \): Mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159)
